Modify your Ansible commands to use the dynamic inventory.

Run your Nginx role against dynamically discovered Azure VMs.

Module 3: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) & Containerization (Days 13-17)
Goal: Deploy a managed Kubernetes cluster and containerize a simple application.

Day 13: Dockerizing a Simple Application

Concept: How to package an application into a Docker image.

Challenge 13.1:

Create a new directory app/web-app/.

Inside, create a simple index.html and a basic Dockerfile to serve it with Nginx (or a simple Flask/Node.js app).

Build the Docker image locally: docker build -t my-web-app:v1 ..

Run the container locally: docker run -p 8080:80 my-web-app:v1. Verify in browser.

Git Practice: Commit and push your app/web-app/ Dockerfile and app.

Day 14: Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Concept: A private Docker registry in Azure to store your container images.

Challenge 14.1:

Extend your infra/azure-basics/ Terraform (or create a new infra/azure-acr/) to provision an Azure Container Registry (ACR).

Output the ACR login server.

Log in to ACR using az acr login.

Access your application via the public IP of the Kubernetes service.

Day 17: Kubernetes Namespaces & Scaling

Concept: Organizing resources with namespaces and scaling applications.

Challenge 18.1:

Install Argo CD onto your AKS cluster. (You can typically find official installation manifests online).

Access the Argo CD UI via port-forwarding.

Retrieve the initial admin password.

Git Practice: Create a new remote Git repository (e.g., kubernetes-config) ‚Äì this will be your "source of truth" for GitOps.

Day 19: Argo CD Application Definition

Concept: How Argo CD defines and syncs applications using an Application custom resource.

Challenge 19.1:

Move your config/simple-app/deployment.yaml and service.yaml into your new kubernetes-config Git repository.

In your local config/argocd/ directory, create simple-app-argocd.yaml.

Day 22: GitOps Best Practices

Concept: Discussion on separation of concerns (infra vs. app config), repository structure for GitOps, and branching strategies.

Challenge 22.1:

Reflect on your current Git repository structure. Discuss how infra, app, and config could be separate repos in a real-world scenario. (No coding, just conceptual understanding).

Goal: Automate building, testing, and deploying using popular CI/CD platforms.

Day 23: GitLab CI/CD Basics

Concept: Introduction to .gitlab-ci.yml, stages, jobs, and runners.

Challenge 23.1:

Push your app/web-app/ code (Dockerfile, index.html) to a new GitLab repository.

Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of this repo.

Define a basic pipeline with a build stage that just prints "Building application..." and a test stage that prints "Running tests...".

Commit and push, observe the pipeline running in GitLab.

Day 24: GitLab CI/CD - Docker Build & Push

Concept: Building and pushing Docker images to ACR from GitLab CI.

Challenge 24.1:

Modify your .gitlab-ci.yml to:

Log in to your Azure Container Registry (ACR).

Build your my-web-app Docker image.

Push the image to ACR with a unique tag (e.g., using $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA).

Commit and push, verify the image appears in ACR.

Day 25: GitHub Actions Basics

Concept: Introduction to .github/workflows/, jobs, steps, and using marketplace actions.

Challenge 25.1:

Push your infra/aks-cluster/ Terraform code to a GitHub repository.

Create a .github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml file.

Define a simple workflow that triggers on push, checks out code, and prints "Running Terraform plan...".

Commit and push, observe the workflow running in GitHub Actions.

Day 26: GitHub Actions - Azure Authentication & Terraform Plan

Concept: Securely authenticating to Azure from GitHub Actions using Service Principals/OIDC.

Challenge 26.1:

Create an Azure Service Principal (via Azure CLI) with Contributor role to your infrastructure Resource Group.

Add the Service Principal credentials as GitHub Secrets to your repository.

Modify terraform-plan.yml to:

Authenticate to Azure using the azure/login action and your secrets.

Install Terraform.

Run terraform init (with remote backend config).

Run terraform plan.

Commit and push, verify the plan output in the workflow logs.

Day 27: GitHub Actions - Terraform Apply (Conditional)

Concept: Automating terraform apply with safeguards (e.g., manual approval, specific branch).

Challenge 27.1:

Add a new job or modify your existing terraform-plan.yml workflow to perform terraform apply.

Implement a safety measure: Make the apply step require manual approval in a GitHub environment, or only run on a specific production branch.

Commit and push, test the apply process.

Module 6: End-to-End GitOps Pipeline (Days 28-30)
Goal: Integrate all tools into a seamless, automated GitOps deployment workflow.

Day 28: Orchestrating the Full Pipeline (Conceptual & Setup)

Concept: How application code changes trigger image builds, which then trigger Kubernetes manifest updates, leading to GitOps deployments.

Challenge 28.1:

Review your three Git repositories:

infra-repo (GitHub): Terraform for Azure (AKS, ACR).

app-code-repo (GitLab): Your application code, Dockerfile, and GitLab CI pipeline.

k8s-config-repo (GitHub or GitLab): Your Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service), watched by Argo CD.

Ensure all repos are set up and connected as in previous challenges.

Day 29: Automated Kubernetes Manifest Update

Concept: The bridge between application CI/CD and GitOps ‚Äì how the CI/CD pipeline updates the K8s manifest in the config repo.

Challenge 29.1:

In your app-code-repo's GitLab CI pipeline (.gitlab-ci.yml):

After building and pushing the Docker image to ACR, add a new stage/job.

This job will clone your k8s-config-repo.

It will then use a tool like sed (or a Python script) to find and replace the image tag in your config/simple-app/deployment.yaml with the newly built image tag (e.g., my-web-app:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA).

It will then commit this change and push it back to the k8s-config-repo.

(Note: This requires GitLab CI to have write access to the k8s-config-repo. You'll need to set up a GitLab deploy token or SSH key for this).

Commit a small change to your application code.

Observe the GitLab CI pipeline run, update the K8s manifest, and push it.

Day 30: End-to-End Validation & Review

Concept: Observing the full GitOps flow in action.

Challenge 30.1:

After Challenge 29.1, open your Argo CD UI.

Observe Argo CD detecting the new commit in k8s-config-repo and automatically deploying the updated application image to AKS.

Access your application's public IP to confirm the new version is live.

Reflect: What did you learn? What were the hardest parts? What are the next steps for deeper learning?

üí° Motivation & Tips for Success
Small Chunks (30 Mins Daily): Stick to the 30-minute commitment. If a challenge takes longer, break it into smaller parts. Consistency beats marathon sessions.

Don't Copy-Paste Blindly: Type out the commands and code. Make mistakes, then fix them. That's how you truly learn.

Understand the "Why": For every command, tool, or configuration, ask "Why am I doing this? What problem does it solve?"

Troubleshooting is Learning: Errors are your best teachers. Read the error messages carefully, and use search engines (Google, Stack Overflow) to find solutions.

Document Your Progress: Keep notes on what you learn, commands you use, and issues you face.

Connect the Dots: After each module, explicitly think about how the new tool or concept fits into the broader DevOps picture.

Visualize: Use diagrams (mental or drawn) to see how components like Git, CI/CD, Argo CD, and AKS interact.

Celebrate Small Wins: Every successful terraform apply, ansible-playbook run, or pipeline green checkmark is a victory!
